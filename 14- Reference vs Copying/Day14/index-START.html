    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const newPlayers = players

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    //console.log(players === newPlayers) // true
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const ans = [...players]
    //console.log(players === ans) // false

    const team = players.slice()
    //console.log(players === team)

    const team2 = [].concat(players)
    //console.log(players === team2) 

    const team4 = Array.from(players)
    //console.log(players === team4) 

    const team5 = players.length = 0 
    console.log(team5)

    function createObj(name){
        return {
          name
        }
    }

    let p1 = createObj('alex')
    let p2 = createObj('sara')
    let p3 = createObj('howard')
    let p4= createObj('thor')

    let f1 = [p1, p2, p3, p4]
    let f2 = f1.slice()

    f2[0].name = 'alexander'; 
    console.log(f1[0].name)


    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    //ans.push(3) 
    //console.table(players, ans)
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80,
      social: {
        facebook: 'norriswu266'
      }
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    //console.log(ans3 === person)
    //console.log(ans3['name'] === person['name'])// 只做一層拷貝

    const team6 = Object.assign({}, person)
    const team7 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person))
    team7.social.facebook = 123

    console.table(team6, team7)

      // let h = 'A',
      // let i = 'A'
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
